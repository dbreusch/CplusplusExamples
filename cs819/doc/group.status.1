Project status for Version 1			(5/13/94)

At minimum, the following things do not work in one way or another:

- During traversal, if a node is not found, an assert is used and the
  program is terminated.  Not the best design choice.  Should be
  changed to just return error code.
- Some execute routines are returning spurious bad return codes.  This
  results in misleading error messages and can be fixed by checking the
  routines to make sure they give valid return codes.
- Arcs to a deleted node are not removed when the node is removed.  This
  will result in nodes not being found (currently a program failure, but
  eventually just an error message).  Should be removed at delete time
  with a search of node list.
- Insert not implemented at all.  This is a relatively major feature that
  should be available.
- Multiple unlabeled arcs can be created between nodes.  This is sort of a
  design choice based on the spec.  However, it would probably be better
  to not allow this (RDB:  any comment?).
- Traversal from a root to itself directly, and probably from any node to
  itself directly is considered impossible.  Another design choice that
  appears to be in error.

Version 2 will be submitted during the day Monday, with corresponding
late points deducted but fewer inadequacies.
