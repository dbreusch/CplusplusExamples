Schedule
--------


April 24:  version 2 will be released.  
		David will be responsible for revised Command and List
	structures that take advantage of inheritance.

April 29:  Version 3 will be released, adding traversal abilities to Graph.
	David is tentatively responsible for basic dfs of graphs and related
	traversal.  A graph will know how to traverse itself, so the Command
	functions related to this, but are the responsibility of Rion.  David
	and Rion will, in all likelyhood, work closely on the traversal
	methods.

May 11:  Development of PseudoNode and insertion mark the final version of
	the program.  All members will work closely at this point to finish
	this task, and test and integrate the final version. 


Class Responsibilities:
----------------------

Class Name: Graph
Version 3; Rion/David, April 29, traversal added

Class Name: Node
Version 3; Rion/David, April 29, traversal added

Class Name: PseudoNode
Version 1; Rion/David/Eric, May 11, a copy method is intended, not reference
	also, general integration and bug squashing may require all members

Class Name: List
Version 1; David, April 24, this refinement may be delayed as necessary
	Will be tested with Element and Command

Class Name: Element
Version 1; David, April 24, this refinement may be delayed as necessary
	Will be tested with List and Command

Class Name: Command (and subclasses)
Version 2: David, April 24, refined Command to take advantage of inheritance
	Will be tested with main routine and Rion's test data
Version 3: Rion/David, April 29, traversal (ie. path, cycle, etc.) are done
	and integrated with Graph methods.
Version 5: Rion/David/Eric, May 11, insert command finished
