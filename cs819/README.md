The General Graph Tool (GGT)

A command driven program that
allows you to create graphs composed of nodes, arcs, labeled arcs
and graphs as nodes.  There are three type of graphs available:  a
normal directed graph, a directed acyclic graph (dag) and a tree.
Commands are read from stdin and all output is sent to stdout.

Run using the "ggt" command.
